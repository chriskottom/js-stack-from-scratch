# js-stack-from-scratch

In an effort to get a handle on the complex ecosystem that's sprung up around Javascript applications over the past several years, I ran through an example application that showed how all the various pieces fit together.

* Yarn - package manager
* Babel - ES6 to ES5 compiler
* Gulp - development task management
* ESLint - linting tool for JS and JSX
* Webpack - asset bundler
* React - UI component framework
* Redux - state container
* Mocha - testing framework
* Chai - testing assertions library
* Sinon - mocking and stubbing
* Flow - static type checking

The tutorial also addresses some of the basics of ES6 including classes, modules, arrow functions, etc.
